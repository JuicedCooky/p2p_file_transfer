Problems encountered:

With tcpstreams, figuring out a way to determine when a connection is closed:
- Make a thread just to figuring out that the connection is closed

Sharing TCP streams:
- Not just making sure that each TCP stream is sharable, had to make sure whatever is using the stream is also thread-safe such as: BuffReader, since it requires to hold onto the stream.

BuffReader:
- Since making sure that the whole line is read is tricky, we had to make use of BuffReader to make sure that each line is read properly using BuffReader::readline() method.
  - Could've create a custom function

Ensuring lock starvation:
- Make sure that either a read or write locks do not hold onto its mutex for too long and starve either read or write
  - Create two different ports exclusively for reading and writing
